<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-two" class="anchor-link"><a href="#chapter-two">Chapter Two<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
<p>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
<p>“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</p>
<p>This was invitation enough.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-three" class="anchor-link"><a href="#chapter-three">Chapter Three<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”</p>
<p>“What is his name?”</p>
<p>“Bingley.”</p>
<p>“Is he married or single?”</p>
